 "ej1.c" finds  the greatest number of a vector of random generated double digits without using any type of mutual exclusion. 
 "ej2.c" does pretty much the same but using a MUTEX. 
 "ej3.c" calculates the jaccard distance of two vectors of integers. 
 "ej4.c" gets a double number as close to Ï€ as we want using the Leibniz serie and a combination of MPI and pthreads.
